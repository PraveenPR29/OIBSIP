            </p>
            <p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand. He is 
               the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block 
               of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a 
               pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi. Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and 
               cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".
               Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team, but after seeing his goalkeeping 
               skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team. 
               His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). 
               Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where 
               he performed well.
               From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway 
               in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.
            </p>
            <p>In 2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years. In the three-match ODI series, Dhoni 
                top-scored for India in all three innings; however, India lost the series 1–2. In the first ODI at Chennai, he helped India 
                recover from 29/5 to help post a total of 227 in 50 overs. Scoring 113 not out, he had a record partnership with Ravichandran 
                Ashwin, although India had lost .
                Winning the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, Dhoni became the first and the only captain in international cricket to claim all ICC 
                trophies. In the rain-shortened final against England, he was out for a duck and ended the tournament with 27 runs from two 
                innings. However, Dhoni's field placements and tactics were to India's advantage, as the team had beat the opposition by five 
                runs (D/L method). He was also named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.
                Just after the Champions Trophy, India toured West Indies for a tri-nation tournament against West Indies and Sri Lanka. 
                Dhoni had gotten injured at the start of the tournament itself and got ruled out for the whole tournament. However, despite 
                not having fully recovered, he returned to play the final against Sri Lanka, once again only to find himself become a hero 
                after single-handedly taking India to a victory by one wicket. Dhoni scored an unbeaten 45 off 52 balls while scoring 16 
                runs in the final over required for the victory. He was adjudged Man of the match for this performance.
                In November 2013, Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate 1,000 or more ODI-runs against 
                Australia.
                India toured South Africa and New Zealand in the 2013–14 season and ending up losing both series, 0–2 and 0–4, respectively. 
                Against South Africa, Dhoni managed 84 runs at an average of 48.0, including one half-century. Against New Zealand, he managed 
                272 runs which included three consecutive 50-plus scores. In the third match of the series, his knock of 50 helped India tie 
                the match and eventually avoiding a series whitewash. Meanwhile, he scored his 8000th run in ODI cricket on the tour.
                India won the away ODI series in England in 2014 by 3–1 and series against West Indies in India by 2–1 margin. Dhoni had 
                performed, as he scored a half-century in each of the series

                    alt="MS Dhoni">
            <p>India's preparation going into the tournament looked poor, as India had failed to perform in the Carlton Mid Triangular Series 
                in Australia, failing to win a single match, with Dhoni himself managing 70 runs from three innings and averaging 23.34.
                During the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group stage matches in such a tournament. 
                India achieved wins against arch-rivals Pakistan, South Africa (whom they hadn't beaten before in a World Cup game), the UAE, 
                West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe. In the match against Zimbabwe at Eden Park, he made 85 not out chasing 288 and had an 
                unbeaten partnership of 196 with Suresh Raina. This is the highest score by an Indian captain on New Zealand soil. Beating 
                Bangladesh in the quarter finals, he became the third overall and the first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches. 
                In an unsuccessful effort against eventual champions Australia in the semi-finals, he made 65 as India were unable to defend 
                their title. Dhoni, however, performed well with the bat by scoring 237 runs in 6 innings at an average of 59.25 and a strike 
                rate of 102.15 and thus, became only the second Indian captain to have an average over 50 and strike rate over 100 in a 
                particular season of the World Cup. </p>
